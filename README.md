# Bubi-BKK
A preliminary project that constructs Budapest’s public transportation network using GTFS data and performs a comparison with the city’s bike-sharing system (Bubi).

This project contains an early-stage implementation for building a detailed transportation network of Budapest using GTFS data. The code processes the official public transit datasets to create a graph-based representation of the city’s bus, tram, metro, and other transit routes.
In addition to the public transport network, the project also incorporates data from Budapest’s bike-sharing system (Bubi). The goal is to compare the structural and spatial characteristics of the two mobility systems, exploring how bike-sharing integrates with and complements the existing public transit infrastructure.
The repository is still in a preliminary state, but it provides the foundations for further analysis, visualization, and network-based research on multimodal transportation in Budapest.
